<h1>I Am Really Freaking Out...</h1>
<h2>A Few Reasons in No Particular Order:</h2>

<p>I have ADHD and the manifestations of this often result in crushing guilt, shame, and paralytic anxiety.</p>
<p>I'm so far behind in schoolwork I have no idea if or how I can ever catch up.</p>
<p>My twins seem to be hell-bent on:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li> making me crazy</li> 
        <li> making each other crazy</li> 
        <li> causing as much destruction and chaos as physically possible.</li>
    </ul>
<p>My oldest son needs help with social skills and executive functions.  I am woefully ill-equipped to handle the latter.</p>    
<p>Paying for activities for all three boys requires a full-time job.
<p>I am looking for a full-time job, thusfar with no success.</p>
<p>Keeping my children from killing each other is also a full-time job, with no pay and minimal return on investment.</p>
